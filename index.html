        <h1>Stephen Jackson vs Manu Ginobili: The "System" Variable</h1>

        <div class="intro">
            <p><strong>Was Stephen Jackson held back by the Spurs system? Or did it make him better?</strong></p>
            <p>This analysis investigates the claim that the "Spurs System" limited Jackson's individual greatness
                compared to Manu Ginobili. By utilizing historical data, we compare Jackson's performance with the Spurs
                versus his time with other teams, and contrast his overall career trajectory with Manu Ginobili's.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Step 1: Direct Head-to-Head Comparison</h2>
        <p>The fairest comparison is looking at the seasons where both players wore the same jersey, playing under the
            same coach (Popovich) and within the same system. We analyzed their stats during their overlapping tenures
            (2002-03, 2011-12, and 2012-13).</p>

        <div class="figure">

            <div class="caption">Figure 1: Comparison of Manu Ginobili and Stephen Jackson during overlapping Spurs
                seasons.</div>
        </div>

        <p><strong>Key Observation:</strong> Even when controlling for the "System" variable (same team, same era), Manu
            Ginobili consistently outperformed Stephen Jackson in:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Shooting Efficiency:</strong> Higher FG% and 3P% in 2 out of 3 overlapping periods.</li>
            <li><strong>Playmaking:</strong> Significantly better Assist-to-Turnover ratios.</li>
            <li><strong>Scoring Punch:</strong> comparable or better points per minute.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step 2: The "System Variable" Test</h2>
        <p>Did leaving the Spurs unlock a higher level of performance for Jackson? If his claim is true, we should see a
            spike in efficiency and "greatness" when he had the freedom of other systems. The data tells a different
            story.</p>

            <div class="caption">Figure 2: Statistical breakdown of Stephen Jackson's performance: Spurs vs. Non-Spurs
                teams.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h3>Analysis of the "Freedom" Effect:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Volume Increased:</strong> Without the Spurs, Jackson played <strong>36% more
                        minutes</strong> and took significantly more shots, leading to a <strong>75% increase in
                        PPG</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Efficiency Stagnated or Dropped:</strong> Despite the increased role, his FG% dropped by
                    <strong>4.8%</strong> and his 3P% essentially plateaued.</li>
                <li><strong>Mistakes Multiplied:</strong> With more ball-handling duties came a <strong>34.6% increase
                        in turnovers</strong> per game.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Career Scoring Context</h3>
        <p>Jackson's scoring volume clearly peaked during his time with Golden State and Charlotte, far away from the
            Spurs system. However, volume does not equal efficiency.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>Step 3: The Verdict & Career Legacy</h2>
        <p>When we look at the complete picture, comparing the longevity, accolades, and sustained excellence of both
            players, the distinction becomes clear.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The data strongly refutes the idea that the Spurs system "held back" Stephen Jackson. In fact, the evidence
            suggests the opposite:</p>
        <p><strong>The Spurs system likely maximized Jackson's efficiency.</strong></p>
        <p>When he left the system:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>He got the volume he wanted (more shots, more minutes).</li>
            <li>But he became <em>less</em> efficient (lower FG%).</li>
            <li>And he committed <em>more</em> turnovers.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In contrast, <strong>Manu Ginobili</strong> thrived within the system for his entire career, posting superior
            efficiency numbers, winning 4 championships, and earning Hall of Fame accolades by prioritizing winning
            impact over raw volume statistics.</p>

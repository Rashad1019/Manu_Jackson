## 🎯 Project Overview

Stephen Jackson has famously claimed he was "hampered" by the San Antonio Spurs system and was a better player than Manu Ginobili. This project puts that claim to the test.

By analyzing historical data from the **2003 Championship season**, the **2012-13 reunion**, and Jackson's "freedom" years with other teams, we answer the question: **Does the data support the narrative?**

## 🔑 Key Findings

*   ✅ **Teammate Comparison:** When sharing the court (same system, same coach), Manu Ginobili consistently outperformed Jackson in efficiency and playmaking.
*   ✅ **The "Freedom" Effect:** When Jackson left the Spurs to find "more volume," he got more shots (PPG ↑ 75%) but his efficiency dropped (FG% ↓ 4.8%) and turnovers spiked.
*   ✅ **The Verdict:** The data suggests the Spurs system **maximized** Jackson's value by hiding his inefficiencies. It did not hamper him; it protected him.
